Hi there, I'm a college student from China who loves front-end development and Vue 👩‍💻

You can check out my blog at [blog.catnaut.net](blog.catnaut.net) where I share my thoughts and tips on web design and coding. 🌐📝

You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/catnaut) where I upload my projects and experiments. 🚀👩‍🔬

I'm always open to learning new things and collaborating with other developers. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. 😊🙌
